Cole emphasized that Bitcoin could be beneficial for businesses.\\nBTC-2.60%\\n0\\n0\\n2h\\n### U.S. Vice President Vance Affirms Continued Bitcoin Holdings According to BlockBeats, U.S. Vice President Vance revealed during his speech at the Bitcoin 2025 Conference that he still holds a significant amount of Bitcoin. His statement underscores the ongoing interest and investment in cryptocurrency by high-profile political figures.\\nBTC-2.60%\\n7\\n3\\n4h\\n### Bitcoin Price Falls Below $108,000 Amid Fed Rate Cut Expectations According to Odaily, Bitcoin's price has dropped below $108,000, potentially influenced by diminished expectations for a Federal Reserve rate cut. Ahead of the Fed's May meeting minutes release, the sentiment in risk asset markets remains cautious. The CME FedWatch tool indicates that the market now anticipates the first rate cut by the Federal Reserve might be postponed until September, with the expected number of rate cuts for 2025 reduced from four to two. Trader TheKingfisher noted that further declines in Bitcoin's price could trigger additional short covering. QCP Capital previously stated that the current market lacks catalysts to drive price fluctuations, resulting in a continued decrease in overall volatility.\\nBTC-2.60%\\n16\\n2\\n5h\\n### Bitcoin Users Recognize National Debt Issues Early, Says CEO According to Foresight News, Anthony Pompliano, founder and CEO of Professional Capital Management, stated that Bitcoin users have been quicker than most to recognize the challenges posed by national debt. He noted that these individuals understand how to allocate capital effectively to benefit from the inevitable depreciation of currency. Pompliano expressed that history will favor those who foresee future trends and take early action.\\nBTC-2.60%\\n9\\n1\\n5h\\n### Bitcoin(BTC) Drops Below 108,000 USDT with a 2.00% Decrease in 24 Hours On May 28, 2025, 14:10 PM(UTC).

The agreement aims to raise a total of 60 million Swedish kronor, approximately $6.23 million, to support the company's new Bitcoin treasury strategy. The net proceeds from this investment will be entirely allocated to purchasing Bitcoin.\\nBTC-2.60%\\n6\\n1\\n7h\\n### Bitcoin Funding Rates Turn Negative Amid Market Shifts According to Foresight News, recent data from Glassnode indicates that Bitcoin's funding rates have shifted to negative. This change suggests a growing presence of short positions among the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Both Binance Coin (BNB) and Cardano (ADA) are showing signs of pressure in the market. Additionally, Solana's funding rate is currently ranked as the sixth lowest among all assets tracked by Glassnode Studio.\\n5\\n0\\n7h\\n### GameStop Announces First Bitcoin Acquisition Amid Rising Share Prices According to Cointelegraph, GameStop, a prominent U.S. video game and consumer electronics retailer, has officially confirmed its initial foray into Bitcoin investment. The company announced the purchase of 4,710 Bitcoin (BTC) in a brief statement shared on X on May 28, marking a significant milestone in its investment strategy.This announcement follows GameStop's earlier disclosure in March 2025, where it revealed plans to venture into Bitcoin investments. At that time, the company indicated its intention to fund the acquisition through debt financing, launching a $1.3 billion convertible notes offering. The decision to invest in Bitcoin comes after months of speculation and reports suggesting GameStop's interest in diversifying into alternative asset classes, including cryptocurrencies, which first emerged in February 2025.The news of GameStop's Bitcoin purchase has had a notable impact on its stock performance. In March, when the company's Bitcoin investment plans were initially reported, GameStop shares experienced a significant surge, increasing by 12%. Earlier speculation regarding Bitcoin investments had already contributed to an 18% rise in the company's stock value. As of May 27, GameStop shares closed at $35, and by the time of publication, they had risen to $36.3 in pre-market trading. Over the past 30 days, the stock has seen an approximate 30% increase, with year-to-date gains of around 10%.This development is part of an ongoing story, and additional details will be provided as they become available. The move by GameStop into Bitcoin investment reflects a broader trend among companies seeking to explore the potential of cryptocurrencies as part of their financial strategies.\\nBTC-2.60%\\n8\\n0\\n8h\\n### Bitcoin's Influence on U.S. Capital Markets Grows According to Foresight News, Ki Young Ju, the founder of CryptoQuant, recently commented on the impact of Michael Saylor's strategies on the U.S. capital markets. Ju noted that Saylor has effectively redirected market liquidity towards Bitcoin, creating a perpetual motion effect among companies with convertible bond operations and Bitcoin reserves. This mechanism continues to be fueled by market volatility, raising questions about when it might cease. The notion of Bitcoin's perpetual rise, once considered a meme, is now gaining traction among long-term Bitcoin advocates.\\nBTC-2.60%\\n2\\n0\\n8h\\n### Traders Anticipate Bitcoin Volatility Ahead of Upcoming Conference According to Odaily, macro researcher Adam from Greeks.live shared insights in an English community briefing, highlighting a prevalent bearish sentiment among traders. Most expect a significant downturn, particularly before the upcoming Bitcoin conference scheduled from May 27 to 29. There is a notable divide between bearish traders anticipating a sharp decline and a bullish trader who predicts the SPX will reach 6650 by the end of July, with Bitcoin potentially hitting $120,000 before correcting to $102,000.Despite the ongoing upward price momentum, the majority of active traders are heavily invested in bearish options spread positions. They plan to increase these positions ahead of the Bitcoin conference, anticipating that the event will lead to a repricing of volatility.\\nBTC-2.60%\\n3\\n0\\n8h\\n### GameStop Shares Rise Following Bitcoin Purchase According to BlockBeats, GameStop Corp. (GME) experienced a 3.68% increase in pre-market trading, with shares currently priced at $36.5. This rise is attributed to the news of a purchase of 4,710 BTC.\\nBTC-2.60%\\n8\\n0\\n9h\\n### Strategy Slows Bitcoin Accumulation Amid Competitive Market According to BlockBeats, Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, has recently slowed its pace of Bitcoin accumulation compared to its peak in November last year. K33 Research Director Vetle Lunde highlighted two main reasons for this slowdown in a report released on Tuesday. Firstly, the premium of Strategy's Class A common stock, MSTR, relative to its Bitcoin holdings has decreased. Secondly, the competition among companies to hoard Bitcoin has intensified.Between May 19 and May 25, Strategy purchased 4,020 Bitcoins at an average price of $106,237, totaling approximately $427.1 million. Of this amount, $348.7 million was financed through its latest $21 billion at-the-market (ATM) offering plan, a significant reduction from the previous week's $705.7 million and the $1.31 billion from May 5 to 11.Lunde noted that the utilization rate of the new $21 billion ATM plan is much lower than the first $21 billion plan. From November 4 to December 16 last year, MSTR raised an average of $2.13 billion per week through ATM financing, whereas the recent three-week average is only $788 million. The emergence of other companies adopting Bitcoin reserves has provided more options for investors, potentially diverting some demand away from MSTR.Additionally, as Strategy's Bitcoin holdings appreciate, maintaining the previous 2x net asset premium requires stronger buying support. Last week, particularly on Friday, the premium of MSTR relative to its Bitcoin holdings dropped sharply from 185% to 163%, marking a new low since April 8. Lunde added that aggressive issuance has accelerated the premium contraction, which may force MSTR to slow down its ATM financing pace. The scenario of last November, where large issuances could still boost the premium, may not be replicable.\\nBTC-2.60%\\n4\\n1\\n11h\\n### Bitcoin(BTC) Surpasses 109,000 USDT with a Narrowed 0.53% Decrease in 24 Hours On May 28, 2025, 08:39 AM(UTC). According to Binance Market Data, Bitcoin has crossed the 109,000 USDT benchmark and is now trading at 109,057.828125 USDT, with a narrowed narrowed 0.53% decrease in 24 hours.\\nBTC-2.60%\\n4\\n0\\n11h\\n### Bitcoin Holders Increase Activity, Reaching New Transfer Peaks According to PANews, recent data from Glassnode indicates a significant rise in activity among long-term Bitcoin holders, with the total transfer volume for those holding Bitcoin for 1-5 years reaching $4.02 billion, marking the highest level since February this year. Within this group, holders of 3-5 years contributed $2.16 billion, the second-highest in this cycle, following the $6 billion peak in March 2024. Meanwhile, the 2-3 year holders transferred $1.41 billion, and the 1-2 year holders moved $450 million. This recent transfer activity among the 1-5 year holding group represents the fifth-largest peak in this cycle, primarily driven by long-term holders. Reviewing other peaks in this cycle, October 2024 saw $9.25 billion dominated by the 1-2 year group, March 2024 had $6.11 billion led by the 2-3 year group, February 2025 recorded $5.42 billion also led by the 2-3 year group, and November 2024 saw $4.39 billion dominated by the 3-5 year group. The current activity suggests that long-term holders are accelerating the release of their Bitcoin holdings.\\nBTC-2.60%\\n2\\n1\\n11h\\n### Metaplanet Raises $50 Million in Zero-Interest Bonds to Boost Bitcoin Holdings According to Cointelegraph, Japanese investment firm Metaplanet is actively pursuing an increase in its Bitcoin exposure by raising $50 million through a private placement of zero-interest bonds. Announced on May 28, these bonds are issued in denominations of $1.25 million and do not offer regular interest payments. Instead, any potential profit for investors is anticipated to come from the bond's redemption value. Evo Fund, an investment firm based in the Cayman Islands, will be the sole bondholder. Evo Fund has been a consistent supporter of Metaplanet's Bitcoin acquisition strategy, participating in multiple rounds of zero-interest bonds to provide capital for Metaplanet's Bitcoin purchases. Metaplanet's bonds are unsecured and unguaranteed, lacking both a bond administrator and collateral, which indicates a significant level of trust between Metaplanet and Evo Fund. This move also underscores confidence in Bitcoin's long-term potential as Metaplanet continues to expand its holdings. The company has stated that the bond issuance is expected to have minimal impact on its financial results for 2025, though it will provide updates if necessary. This strategy reflects a broader trend among companies seeking alternatives to traditional fiat-based treasury strategies. Metaplanet's recent activities include its second-largest Bitcoin purchase, acquiring 1,004 Bitcoin valued at over $100 million, which increased its total Bitcoin holdings to 7,800 BTC, worth over $800 million. According to BitcoinTreasuries.NET, Metaplanet's Bitcoin investments have appreciated by nearly 20%. This aggressive Bitcoin strategy has also positively impacted Metaplanet's stock prices. On May 27, 10x Research reported that Metaplanet's stock is trading as if Bitcoin were valued at five times its actual price, suggesting that investors might be overpaying for their Bitcoin exposure through the company. The rising stock prices of companies with significant Bitcoin holdings have attracted criticism from notable investors like Jim Chanos. Speaking at the Sohn Investment Conference in New York, Chanos revealed that he is selling MicroStrategy stock to purchase Bitcoin directly. His decision is based on the belief that investors are overpaying for Bitcoin exposure through corporate entities like MicroStrategy, and that direct Bitcoin purchases would be more advantageous. This perspective highlights the ongoing debate over the best methods for gaining Bitcoin exposure in the investment community.\\nBTC-2.60%\\n2\\n2\\n13h\\n### U.S. Government Explores Bitcoin Acquisition Options According to PANews, David Sacks, the head of artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency affairs at the U.S. White House, discussed potential government strategies for acquiring more Bitcoin at the Bitcoin 2025 conference. Sacks emphasized that while he cannot make any promises, there are avenues for the U.S. government to purchase additional Bitcoin. He noted that if the acquisition could be funded in a 'budget-neutral' manner, without imposing taxes or increasing the national debt, it would be feasible for the government to proceed with such purchases. Sacks highlighted the importance of gaining the interest of the Treasury or Commerce Department in this initiative. He stated that if these departments become enthusiastic about the idea and can devise a funding strategy, they would effectively have the authorization from U.S. President Donald Trump to move forward with the acquisition.\\nBTC-2.60%\\n10\\n3\\n16h\\n### Bitcoin Spot ETFs Experience Significant Net Inflows and Outflows According to PANews, data from SoSoValue indicates that on May 27, Bitcoin spot ETFs saw a total net inflow of $385 million. The largest single-day net inflow was recorded by Blackrock's ETF IBIT, which received $409 million, bringing its historical total net inflow to $48.394 billion. Grayscale's Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF BTC followed with a single-day net inflow of $36.029 million, accumulating a historical total net inflow of $1.414 billion. Conversely, the Bitcoin spot ETF with the largest single-day net outflow was Ark Invest and 21Shares' ETF ARKB, which saw an outflow of $38.335 million. ARKB's historical total net inflow currently stands at $2.687 billion. As of the latest report, the total net asset value of Bitcoin spot ETFs is $132.895 billion, with an ETF net asset ratio of 6.1% compared to Bitcoin's total market value. The historical cumulative net inflow has reached $44.911 billion.\\nBTC-2.60%\\n6\\n2\\n16h\\n### BlackRock Executive Recommends Bitcoin Allocation at Conference According to Odaily, a spokesperson from BlackRock, the world's largest asset management firm overseeing $11 trillion, suggested at the Bitcoin 2025 Conference that investors allocate 2% of their portfolios to Bitcoin. This recommendation highlights the growing acceptance of cryptocurrency in traditional investment strategies.\\nBTC-2.60%\\n7\\n2\\n17h\\n### Bitcoin's Potential Growth Surpasses Gold, Says BlackRock Executive According to BlockBeats, Robert Mitchnick, the head of digital assets at BlackRock, stated at the Bitcoin 2025 conference that Bitcoin has a significantly higher potential for growth compared to gold. Mitchnick's remarks highlight the increasing interest and optimism surrounding Bitcoin's future prospects in the financial markets.\\nBTC-2.60%\\n12\\n1\\n18h\\n### Bitcoin's Potential Surge to $1 Million with Wall Street Investment According to PANews, Michael Saylor, Chairman of the Board at Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), stated at the Bitcoin 2025 Conference that Bitcoin's price could reach $1 million if Wall Street holds 10% of the cryptocurrency. Saylor's remarks highlight the potential impact of institutional investment on Bitcoin's market value.\\nBTC-2.60%\\n10\\n0\\nExplore the latest crypto news\\n⚡️ Be a part of the latests discussions in crypto\\n💬 Interact with your favorite creators\\n👍 Enjoy content that interests you\\nEmail / Phone number\\nSign Up\\nLogin\\nRelevant Creator\\n \\nBinance News\\n@Binance_News\\nFollow\\nTrending Topics\\nBinanceHODLerSOPH 1.3M views 3,298 DiscussingBitcoin2025 6.9M views 12,995 DiscussingTrumpMediaBitcoinTreasury 2.5M views 4,697 DiscussingView More\\nFear & Greed Index ------------------Trade Now\\n68 Greed\\nHow do you feel about BTC today？\\nBearish Bullish\\nMost Searched (6H)\\nUSDT\\n A Rapid Riser 0.739 -5.24% SOPH Rapid Riser 0.06452 +115.07% TON Rapid Riser 3.403 +13.43%\\nSuggested Creators\\n\\nBinance Risk Sniper\\nStay ahead on risk warnings, risk sniping, and shared risk knowledge with the official Binance Risk team.

Ahead of the Fed's May meeting minutes release, the sentiment in risk asset markets remains cautious. The CME FedWatch tool indicates that the market now anticipates the first rate cut by the Federal Reserve might be postponed until September, with the expected number of rate cuts for 2025 reduced from four to two. Trader TheKingfisher noted that further declines in Bitcoin's price could trigger additional short covering.

      "### GameStop Announces First Bitcoin Acquisition Amid Rising Share Prices According to Cointelegraph, GameStop, a prominent U.S. video game and consumer electronics retailer, has officially confirmed its initial foray into Bitcoin investment. The company announced the purchase of 4,710 Bitcoin (BTC) in a brief statement shared on X on May 28, marking a significant milestone in its investment strategy.This announcement follows GameStop's earlier disclosure in March 2025, where it revealed plans to venture into Bitcoin investments. At that time, the company indicated its intention to fund the acquisition through debt financing, launching a $1.3 billion convertible notes offering. The decision to invest in Bitcoin comes after months of speculation and reports suggesting GameStop's interest in diversifying into alternative asset classes, including cryptocurrencies, which first emerged in February 2025.The news of GameStop's Bitcoin purchase has had a notable impact on its stock performance. In March, when the company's Bitcoin investment plans were initially reported, GameStop shares experienced a significant surge, increasing by 12%. Earlier speculation regarding Bitcoin investments had already contributed to an 18% rise in the company's stock value. As of May 27, GameStop shares closed at $35, and by the time of publication, they had risen to $36.3 in pre-market trading. Over the past 30 days, the stock has seen an approximate 30% increase, with year-to-date gains of around 10%.This development is part of an ongoing story, and additional details will be provided as they become available. The move by GameStop into Bitcoin investment reflects a broader trend among companies seeking to explore the potential of cryptocurrencies as part of their financial strategies.\n",

      "### Strategy Slows Bitcoin Accumulation Amid Competitive Market According to BlockBeats, Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, has recently slowed its pace of Bitcoin accumulation compared to its peak in November last year. K33 Research Director Vetle Lunde highlighted two main reasons for this slowdown in a report released on Tuesday. Firstly, the premium of Strategy's Class A common stock, MSTR, relative to its Bitcoin holdings has decreased. Secondly, the competition among companies to hoard Bitcoin has intensified.Between May 19 and May 25, Strategy purchased 4,020 Bitcoins at an average price of $106,237, totaling approximately $427.1 million. Of this amount, $348.7 million was financed through its latest $21 billion at-the-market (ATM) offering plan, a significant reduction from the previous week's $705.7 million and the $1.31 billion from May 5 to 11.Lunde noted that the utilization rate of the new $21 billion ATM plan is much lower than the first $21 billion plan. From November 4 to December 16 last year, MSTR raised an average of $2.13 billion per week through ATM financing, whereas the recent three-week average is only $788 million. The emergence of other companies adopting Bitcoin reserves has provided more options for investors, potentially diverting some demand away from MSTR.Additionally, as Strategy's Bitcoin holdings appreciate, maintaining the previous 2x net asset premium requires stronger buying support. Last week, particularly on Friday, the premium of MSTR relative to its Bitcoin holdings dropped sharply from 185% to 163%, marking a new low since April 8. Lunde added that aggressive issuance has accelerated the premium contraction, which may force MSTR to slow down its ATM financing pace. The scenario of last November, where large issuances could still boost the premium, may not be replicable.\n",

      "### Bitcoin Holders Increase Activity, Reaching New Transfer Peaks According to PANews, recent data from Glassnode indicates a significant rise in activity among long-term Bitcoin holders, with the total transfer volume for those holding Bitcoin for 1-5 years reaching $4.02 billion, marking the highest level since February this year. Within this group, holders of 3-5 years contributed $2.16 billion, the second-highest in this cycle, following the $6 billion peak in March 2024. Meanwhile, the 2-3 year holders transferred $1.41 billion, and the 1-2 year holders moved $450 million. This recent transfer activity among the 1-5 year holding group represents the fifth-largest peak in this cycle, primarily driven by long-term holders. Reviewing other peaks in this cycle, October 2024 saw $9.25 billion dominated by the 1-2 year group, March 2024 had $6.11 billion led by the 2-3 year group, February 2025 recorded $5.42 billion also led by the 2-3 year group, and November 2024 saw $4.39 billion dominated by the 3-5 year group. The current activity suggests that long-term holders are accelerating the release of their Bitcoin holdings.\n",

      "### Metaplanet Raises $50 Million in Zero-Interest Bonds to Boost Bitcoin Holdings According to Cointelegraph, Japanese investment firm Metaplanet is actively pursuing an increase in its Bitcoin exposure by raising $50 million through a private placement of zero-interest bonds. Announced on May 28, these bonds are issued in denominations of $1.25 million and do not offer regular interest payments. Instead, any potential profit for investors is anticipated to come from the bond's redemption value. Evo Fund, an investment firm based in the Cayman Islands, will be the sole bondholder. Evo Fund has been a consistent supporter of Metaplanet's Bitcoin acquisition strategy, participating in multiple rounds of zero-interest bonds to provide capital for Metaplanet's Bitcoin purchases. Metaplanet's bonds are unsecured and unguaranteed, lacking both a bond administrator and collateral, which indicates a significant level of trust between Metaplanet and Evo Fund. This move also underscores confidence in Bitcoin's long-term potential as Metaplanet continues to expand its holdings. The company has stated that the bond issuance is expected to have minimal impact on its financial results for 2025, though it will provide updates if necessary. This strategy reflects a broader trend among companies seeking alternatives to traditional fiat-based treasury strategies. Metaplanet's recent activities include its second-largest Bitcoin purchase, acquiring 1,004 Bitcoin valued at over $100 million, which increased its total Bitcoin holdings to 7,800 BTC, worth over $800 million. According to BitcoinTreasuries.NET, Metaplanet's Bitcoin investments have appreciated by nearly 20%. This aggressive Bitcoin strategy has also positively impacted Metaplanet's stock prices. On May 27, 10x Research reported that Metaplanet's stock is trading as if Bitcoin were valued at five times its actual price, suggesting that investors might be overpaying for their Bitcoin exposure through the company. The rising stock prices of companies with significant Bitcoin holdings have attracted criticism from notable investors like Jim Chanos. Speaking at the Sohn Investment Conference in New York, Chanos revealed that he is selling MicroStrategy stock to purchase Bitcoin directly. His decision is based on the belief that investors are overpaying for Bitcoin exposure through corporate entities like MicroStrategy, and that direct Bitcoin purchases would be more advantageous. This perspective highlights the ongoing debate over the best methods for gaining Bitcoin exposure in the investment community.\n",

      "### U.S. Government Explores Bitcoin Acquisition Options According to PANews, David Sacks, the head of artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency affairs at the U.S. White House, discussed potential government strategies for acquiring more Bitcoin at the Bitcoin 2025 conference. Sacks emphasized that while he cannot make any promises, there are avenues for the U.S. government to purchase additional Bitcoin. He noted that if the acquisition could be funded in a 'budget-neutral' manner, without imposing taxes or increasing the national debt, it would be feasible for the government to proceed with such purchases. Sacks highlighted the importance of gaining the interest of the Treasury or Commerce Department in this initiative. He stated that if these departments become enthusiastic about the idea and can devise a funding strategy, they would effectively have the authorization from U.S. President Donald Trump to move forward with the acquisition.\n",

       "   'BODY': 'While Avalanche (AVAX) is going to $35, it’s Ruvi AI (RUVI) that’s got the crypto world buzzing with 13,233% returns. With investors looking for exponential growth, Ruvi AI is the game-changer in the blockchain and AI space for those ready to grab the next big opportunity. Avalanche (AVAX): $35 Avalanche has been touted as one of the most scalable and efficient blockchain platforms out there. 4,500 transactions per second and low fees has made it a hub for dApps and DeFi projects. AVAX to $35 is backed by its growing adoption and strong performance in the market. But as a more mature project, Avalanche’s growth potential is now relatively small compared to emerging projects with groundbreaking innovation and early stage returns. Ruvi AI: A Disruptor at the intersection of AI and Blockchain Ruvi AI is boldly going where no one has gone before by combining blockchain with AI. This platform enables decentralized content creation, allowing users to generate AI driven text, images, videos and audio assets for entertainment, marketing and business automation. What sets Ruvi AI apart is its utility. Unlike Avalanche’s large dApp ecosystem which often focuses on niche applications, Ruvi AI is solving immediate high demand business needs. The $RUVI token is at the heart of its offerings, a gateway to premium AI features, governance and staking rewards. With its practical approach to blockchain innovation, Ruvi AI is leading the charge for real world change, making it an attractive opportunity for investors. A Hot Presale Defining 2025 Ruvi AI’s presale has already made waves in the investor community. Phase 1 launched at $0.010 per token and sold out in 2 weeks. Phase 2 is now live at $0.015 and early backers have already seen 50% returns.The project has 1,400+ holders and is gaining momentum with its achievements. It has listed its token and partnered with a major exchange, Ruvi AI is committed to growth and long term success. More announcements to come and the project will only get stronger and more investor confidence. 13,233% Returns Why are analysts projecting such huge returns for Ruvi AI? It’s all about the technology, community and partnerships. Technology : By combining AI with blockchain, Ruvi AI provides solutions that resonate across industries, adoption beyond early adopters. Expanding Investor Base : 1,400+ holders is strong market confidence in Ruvi AI. Strategic Partnerships and Visibility : Exchanges and listings will increase Ruvi AI’s visibility and market presence. Exponential Growth Potential : Unlike Avalanche, Ruvi AI is in its infancy, early backers have huge upside. At $0.015 per token, the project is still accessible to a broader range of investors who will benefit from its growth. Given its disruption potential, Ruvi AI is an opportunity to change your life. Investment Scenarios with Ruvi AI Ruvi AI has different investment tiers through its VIP presale model. Here’s how the returns look like for the three VIP tiers based on its listing price of $0.07 and the predicted $1 price post listing. VIP 2 Threshold : 50,000 $RUVI ($750 at $0.015/token) Bonus : 40% (+20,000 tokens) Total Tokens : 70,000 Value at Listing Price ($0.07) : $4,900 Value at Predicted Price ($1) : $70,000 VIP 3 Threshold : 100,000 $RUVI ($1,500 at $0.015/token) Bonus : 60% (+60,000 tokens) Total Tokens : 160,000 Value at Listing Price ($0.07) : $11,200 Value at Predicted Price ($1) : $160,000 VIP 5 Threshold : 500,000 $RUVI ($7,500 at $0.015/token) Bonus : 100% (+500,000 tokens) Total Tokens : 1,000,000 Value at Listing Price ($0.07) : $70,000 Value at Predicted Price ($1) : $1,000,000 These numbers are mind blowing and Ruvi AI is an opportunity like no other for those who want to get in on the presale. Now or Never AVAX is great and all but Ruvi AI offers early stage growth and disruption. For those who want exponential returns, Ruvi AI’s presale is the moment to get in on a project that will change the future of decentralized innovation.

       "   'BODY': 'Ethereum Foundation researcher Justin Drake has warned about the security of the Bitcoin Network. Drake shared his view on X, noting that the Bitcoin Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism is a ticking time bomb. The blockchain security expert, one of the masterminds behind the Merge, i.e., Ethereum transition from PoW to Proof of Stake (PoS), identified Bitcoin’s low fees as the major risk to its security. According to Drake , Bitcoin fees have fallen for 13 years, with miners generating less than 10 BTC in daily fees. He believes that this low fee represents a disincentive for most miners who are the ones securing the network and could eventually affect the network, a contagion risk for the whole crypto industry. He said: “Bitcoin’s security model is broken. If Bitcoin gets taken over, the fallout could take the entire crypto ecosystem. The systemic risks can’t be ignored.” The researcher noted that Bitcoin fees have constantly declined for over a decade despite halving and reducing the issuance rate. In fact, the fees are falling faster than the issuance rate on the network, with a 30-day moving average (MA) of Bitcoin transaction fees currently at 6.5 BTC per day. Bitcoin Transaction Fees.(Source: X/Drake) This meant that fees only account for around 1% of miners’ revenue over the years, and Bitcoin miners could see a 100% decline in their revenue once the complete 21 million BTC have been mined. However, Category Labs researcher Kushal Babel disagreed with the argument, noting that denominating fees in BTC to say it is at an all-time low is wrong. According to him, the whole argument might change if BTC fees are denominated in US Dollars. Babel argued that Drake’s opinion that the ratio of BTC market cap to the amount securing it makes the network vulnerable to a 51% attack is a weak argument at best, and the focus should be on the cost of an attack in dollars. Higher prices may not save the Bitcoin network from attack Meanwhile, Drake added that a rise in Bitcoin prices could be inimical to network security because it would make it harder to sustain the BTC-denominated fees. In order to explain this, he described a scenario where Bitcoin price increases but fees stay unchanged, noting that fees at the time will only cover around 10% of the security cost for the network. He said: “Let’s be optimistic and say BTC rises to $1M, and today’s 6.5 BTC/day in fees is maintained: $6.5M/day in fees, 10% of today’s security budget. Bitcoin would be a $20T asset secured by 1/10th of today’s hashing infrastructure.” Thus, he believes that the cost of attacking the Bitcoin network will not increase even as the price of BTC increases. This could make it possible for a 51% attack on the Bitcoin network to cost as little as $20 billion, even if the network has a market cap of $200 trillion tokens. Drake further debunked the presumption that Bitcoin fees will increase, noting that this has not happened in the last 13 years. He added that all previous attempts to boost Bitcoin fees by increasing its utility as a transaction layer have failed to achieve sustainable long-term gains, with projects such as Ordinals, Liquid, Omni, Babylon, and others only creating short-term spikes. Potential solutions to Bitcoin’s fragile security With Drake highlighting Bitcoin’s risks, he proposed two solutions that could work for the network if fees do not increase. According to him, the solution is for Bitcoin to expand the total supply beyond the 21 million cap or for the network to switch to Proof of Stake. Unsurprisingly, he acknowledged that these two proposed solutions are unlikely to be implemented, given that they are completely against the conventional ethos of the Bitcoin community. However, he insisted that creating a Bitcoin Virtual Machine or Proof of Authority, where the major mining pools will secure the network, is unlikely to work. Still, he called on anyone who could explain how the PoA will function to do so. Interestingly, other users have proposed more potential solutions. Ethereum Foundation researcher Ansgar Dieetrichs recommended that Bitcoin developers end congestion pricing and increase the fee floor with the hope that the revenue is enough. He noted that this is likely the best solution for the network, but added other options, such as Bitcoin becoming a Layer-2 on a secure PoS chain or becoming an ERC-20 token. Other solutions include mining at a loss or allowing centralized custodians and large BTC holders to donate to on-chain security. Unsurprisingly, not everyone welcomed the opinion, especially among Bitcoin supporters. Bitcoin maxi Udi Wizardheimer criticized the opinion, noting that Drake is concerned about a security problem that Ethereum might have in 100 years, when Ethereum is struggling presently.

       "   'BODY': 'Two men suspected in the kidnapping and torture of a 28-year-old Italian cryptocurrency investor have pleaded not guilty, while the investigation into their case appears to have expanded to the New York Police Department itself. New York police had previously arrested William Duplessie , 33, and John Woeltz , 37, on the charges, as well as a third individual, Beatrice Folchi, 24, though her prosecution is being deferred. The victim has not been publicly named. The men are accused of kidnapping the victim and holding him hostage in a luxury townhouse in Manhattan’s ritzy SoHo neighborhood for more than two weeks. During that time, New York City police say the trio tortured the man, forcing him to take drugs, dangling him from a ledge, urinating on him and electrocuting him in an effort to force him to hand over the private keys to his bitcoin. The alleged perpetrators are accused of making t-shirts of the victim with a crack pipe in his mouth and taking Polaroids of the victim with a gun to his head. The victim escaped last Friday, grabbing his laptop and getting out of the townhouse and then seeking help from a traffic officer. Duplessie entered a not-guilty plea to five different charges, including kidnapping with an intent to collect a ransom, kidnapping and causing a physical injury, criminal possession of a loaded firearm, assault with an intent to cause a physical injury with a weapon and unlawful imprisonment, according to the court docket. Woeltz was charged with kidnapping, assault, unlawful imprisonment and criminal possession of a firearm, and he also pleaded not guilty, according to his court docket. Two NYPD officers, including a detective assigned to Mayor Eric Adams\\' protection detail, worked for both Duplessie and Woeltz in their off-duty hours and have now been placed on modified duty, Bloomberg reported Thursday. A source familiar told CoinDesk that the two officers are not believed to be part of the kidnapping, but rather did security work for the defendants. They may have driven the victim from an airport to the townhouse, but have not been tied to his torture, the source said. A spokesperson for the NYPD said the matter was \"under internal review.\" A spokesperson for the mayor\\'s office said in a statement that, \"Every city employee is expected to follow the law, including our officers, both on and off duty. We are disturbed by these allegations, and as soon as it came to our attention, the officers were placed on modified duty. The investigation is ongoing.\" UPDATE (May 29, 2025, 22:27 UTC): Adds additional detail.',\n",

       "  'BODY': 'While Avalanche (AVAX) is going to $35, it’s Ruvi AI (RUVI) that’s got the crypto world buzzing with 13,233% returns. With investors looking for exponential growth, Ruvi AI is the game-changer in the blockchain and AI space for those ready to grab the next big opportunity. Avalanche (AVAX): $35 Avalanche has been touted as one of the most scalable and efficient blockchain platforms out there. 4,500 transactions per second and low fees has made it a hub for dApps and DeFi projects. AVAX to $35 is backed by its growing adoption and strong performance in the market. But as a more mature project, Avalanche’s growth potential is now relatively small compared to emerging projects with groundbreaking innovation and early stage returns.

       "  'BODY': 'Ethereum Foundation researcher Justin Drake has warned about the security of the Bitcoin Network. Drake shared his view on X, noting that the Bitcoin Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism is a ticking time bomb. The blockchain security expert, one of the masterminds behind the Merge, i.e., Ethereum transition from PoW to Proof of Stake (PoS), identified Bitcoin’s low fees as the major risk to its security. According to Drake , Bitcoin fees have fallen for 13 years, with miners generating less than 10 BTC in daily fees. He believes that this low fee represents a disincentive for most miners who are the ones securing the network and could eventually affect the network, a contagion risk for the whole crypto industry. He said: “Bitcoin’s security model is broken. If Bitcoin gets taken over, the fallout could take the entire crypto ecosystem. The systemic risks can’t be ignored.” The researcher noted that Bitcoin fees have constantly declined for over a decade despite halving and reducing the issuance rate. In fact, the fees are falling faster than the issuance rate on the network, with a 30-day moving average (MA) of Bitcoin transaction fees currently at 6.5 BTC per day. Bitcoin Transaction Fees.(Source: X/Drake) This meant that fees only account for around 1% of miners’ revenue over the years, and Bitcoin miners could see a 100% decline in their revenue once the complete 21 million BTC have been mined. However, Category Labs researcher Kushal Babel disagreed with the argument, noting that denominating fees in BTC to say it is at an all-time low is wrong. According to him, the whole argument might change if BTC fees are denominated in US Dollars. Babel argued that Drake’s opinion that the ratio of BTC market cap to the amount securing it makes the network vulnerable to a 51% attack is a weak argument at best, and the focus should be on the cost of an attack in dollars. Higher prices may not save the Bitcoin network from attack Meanwhile, Drake added that a rise in Bitcoin prices could be inimical to network security because it would make it harder to sustain the BTC-denominated fees. In order to explain this, he described a scenario where Bitcoin price increases but fees stay unchanged, noting that fees at the time will only cover around 10% of the security cost for the network. He said: “Let’s be optimistic and say BTC rises to $1M, and today’s 6.5 BTC/day in fees is maintained: $6.5M/day in fees, 10% of today’s security budget. Bitcoin would be a $20T asset secured by 1/10th of today’s hashing infrastructure.” Thus, he believes that the cost of attacking the Bitcoin network will not increase even as the price of BTC increases. This could make it possible for a 51% attack on the Bitcoin network to cost as little as $20 billion, even if the network has a market cap of $200 trillion tokens. Drake further debunked the presumption that Bitcoin fees will increase, noting that this has not happened in the last 13 years. He added that all previous attempts to boost Bitcoin fees by increasing its utility as a transaction layer have failed to achieve sustainable long-term gains, with projects such as Ordinals, Liquid, Omni, Babylon, and others only creating short-term spikes. Potential solutions to Bitcoin’s fragile security With Drake highlighting Bitcoin’s risks, he proposed two solutions that could work for the network if fees do not increase. According to him, the solution is for Bitcoin to expand the total supply beyond the 21 million cap or for the network to switch to Proof of Stake. Unsurprisingly, he acknowledged that these two proposed solutions are unlikely to be implemented, given that they are completely against the conventional ethos of the Bitcoin community. However, he insisted that creating a Bitcoin Virtual Machine or Proof of Authority, where the major mining pools will secure the network, is unlikely to work. Still, he called on anyone who could explain how the PoA will function to do so. Interestingly, other users have proposed more potential solutions. Ethereum Foundation researcher Ansgar Dieetrichs recommended that Bitcoin developers end congestion pricing and increase the fee floor with the hope that the revenue is enough. He noted that this is likely the best solution for the network, but added other options, such as Bitcoin becoming a Layer-2 on a secure PoS chain or becoming an ERC-20 token. Other solutions include mining at a loss or allowing centralized custodians and large BTC holders to donate to on-chain security. Unsurprisingly, not everyone welcomed the opinion, especially among Bitcoin supporters. Bitcoin maxi Udi Wizardheimer criticized the opinion, noting that Drake is concerned about a security problem that Ethereum might have in 100 years, when Ethereum is struggling presently.

       "  'BODY': 'Two men suspected in the kidnapping and torture of a 28-year-old Italian cryptocurrency investor have pleaded not guilty, while the investigation into their case appears to have expanded to the New York Police Department itself. New York police had previously arrested William Duplessie , 33, and John Woeltz , 37, on the charges, as well as a third individual, Beatrice Folchi, 24, though her prosecution is being deferred. The victim has not been publicly named. The men are accused of kidnapping the victim and holding him hostage in a luxury townhouse in Manhattan’s ritzy SoHo neighborhood for more than two weeks. During that time, New York City police say the trio tortured the man, forcing him to take drugs, dangling him from a ledge, urinating on him and electrocuting him in an effort to force him to hand over the private keys to his bitcoin. The alleged perpetrators are accused of making t-shirts of the victim with a crack pipe in his mouth and taking Polaroids of the victim with a gun to his head. The victim escaped last Friday, grabbing his laptop and getting out of the townhouse and then seeking help from a traffic officer. Duplessie entered a not-guilty plea to five different charges, including kidnapping with an intent to collect a ransom, kidnapping and causing a physical injury, criminal possession of a loaded firearm, assault with an intent to cause a physical injury with a weapon and unlawful imprisonment, according to the court docket. Woeltz was charged with kidnapping, assault, unlawful imprisonment and criminal possession of a firearm, and he also pleaded not guilty, according to his court docket. Two NYPD officers, including a detective assigned to Mayor Eric Adams\\' protection detail, worked for both Duplessie and Woeltz in their off-duty hours and have now been placed on modified duty, Bloomberg reported Thursday. A source familiar told CoinDesk that the two officers are not believed to be part of the kidnapping, but rather did security work for the defendants. They may have driven the victim from an airport to the townhouse, but have not been tied to his torture, the source said. A spokesperson for the NYPD said the matter was \"under internal review.\" A spokesperson for the mayor\\'s office said in a statement that, \"Every city employee is expected to follow the law, including our officers, both on and off duty. We are disturbed by these allegations, and as soon as it came to our attention, the officers were placed on modified duty. The investigation is ongoing.\" UPDATE (May 29, 2025, 22:27 UTC): Adds additional detail.'}]"
