            "resumo": "Bitcoin just broke another record by staying above $100,000 for 30 days in a row, the first time that’s ever happened since the cryptocurrency was created. This streak started after its last dip below six figures on May 8, and not once since then has it closed under that level. The price pulled back from its May 22 all-time high of $112,000, dropping to $100,428 by Friday, but heavy weekend buying pushed it back to $105,000. By Monday, it had surged again to $110,000, with traders responding to renewed optimism around US-China trade discussions. The fact that it hasn’t broken below $100K for a full month has crypto traders calling it a key milestone—even if some still see it more as a psychological checkpoint than a technical win. Still, it’s a major line that held strong, and analysts are watching closely to see what’s next. Traders defend $100K on pullbacks Read Harvey, a technical analyst at Wolfe Research, told CNBC the move above $100K wasn’t just about hype. “What really stood out to us was price’s ability to hold that level on the back test, when it briefly fell to $100,000 on Thursday. It also happened to align perfectly with the 50-day moving average,” Read said. He added that he sees the current setup as a launchpad toward the previous high of $112,000. Read also expects Bitcoin to spend a bit more time consolidating around its current level before any breakout to new highs, saying a temporary pause is normal after such a run. While short-term traders are focused on charts and averages, others are looking at the bigger picture. Ben Kurland, CEO of crypto analytics platform DYOR, said this $100,000 level is no longer just about market emotion. “$100,000 isn’t just speculative froth now,” Ben said. “It’s a new floor being tested and held by institutional flows, ETF inflows , and a maturing investor base.” He added that the pattern of short-lived pumps followed by sharp retracements is starting to fade. Ben believes this consolidation is healthy and sets up Bitcoin for the next move. “If $100,000 is the new base,” he said, “then $120,000-$130,000 becomes the next logical zone—especially as macro conditions stabilize and sidelined capital seeks asymmetric upside.” Long-term holders sell, ETFs keep buying While institutions and funds continue to buy, some older holders are starting to cash in. Tyrone Ross, founder and president of advisory firm 401 Financial, said the 30-day stretch above $100K might not be a massive technical feat, but it still matters. “On-chain data shows long-term holders are selling,” Tyrone said. He explained that while demand from ETFs and companies remains strong, retail investors haven’t returned in full force yet. But if Bitcoin keeps holding these levels, he said, retail interest is likely to come back in waves. Tyrone pointed out that May 27 saw a big shift. At that point, when Bitcoin was around $109,000, spending by long-term holders—people who’ve held for at least six months—shot up to around 40,000 Bitcoin, according to CryptoQuant. That’s since dropped all the way down to about 6,000 as of Monday. Over the same stretch, overall 30-day demand has fallen too, from 228,000 Bitcoin down to 126,000. That slowdown might cool the pace of price growth in the short term, according to Julio Moreno, head of research at CryptoQuant. Still, Bitcoin keeps pushing. On Tuesday, it was trading at roughly $108,800, about 3% below its peak. Earlier that same day, it climbed to $110,500, its highest point since the May 22 record. With this current streak still intact, everyone’s watching to see if $100K becomes more than just a floor—whether it becomes the new normal.

Each taps into a unique market force, blending nostalgia and community-fueled hype with growing on-chain activity. As altcoin season nears, trading volumes are rising and whale accumulation is intensifying. These altcoins are now in the spotlight for what could become one of the most explosive rallies of the year. FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) Intelligent Market Strategy: The Key To 20,000% Explosive ROI And More FloppyPepe (FPPE) is the first altcoin to deploy a live AI trading agent, FloppyAI , capable of analyzing whale movement, scanning market sentiment, and providing data-backed insights that guide traders toward optimal entries and exits. This removes emotion from trading and introduces predictive precision, key for explosive ROI scenarios, like the projected 20,000% return in the next altcoin season. Its ingenious tokenomics, known as Floppynomics , further amplifies the momentum: 3% of every transaction is automatically redistributed, 1% burned to reduce supply, 1% rewarded to holders, and 1% donated to charity, creating a self-sustaining loop of scarcity, loyalty, and goodwill. FloppyPepe (FPPE) has also passed a full SolidProof audit , assuring it’s free from threats, code anomalies, or portfolio risks. With its unique blend of AI, scarcity mechanics, and secured infrastructure, top analysts are eyeing FloppyPepe (FPPE) as a leading candidate ahead of PEPE and Shiba Inu (SHIB) for a 20,000% ROI in two weeks during this upcoming altcoin season. Pepe (PEPE) Gears Up For Parabolic Run As Momentum Builds Pepe (PEPE) is generating serious buzz as top analysts and traders converge on one point: the final wave has begun. A recent post by top analyst STEPH IN CRYPTO showcases what many interpret as a classic bullish chart formation, suggesting that Pepe (PEPE) is on the verge of its most aggressive rally yet. With altcoin season heating up, projections are pointing toward a staggering 20,000% surge within just two weeks. Pepe’s (PEPE) price action is tightening near key resistance levels, supported by rising whale accumulation and growing market attention, reinforcing sentiment that PEPE could outperform in the high-volatility meme coin category. If this setup holds, the momentum could carry Pepe (PEPE) into uncharted territory, solidifying its status as a top altcoin in the next altcoin season. Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) Setup Suggests Massive Gains As Altcoins Heat Up Shiba Inu (SHIB) is coming up as a potential front-runner in the upcoming altcoin season, with bullish signals aligning across technical and market sentiment indicators. A recent post by top analyst Whale.Guru suggests a sharp upward breakout for Shiba Inu (SHIB) if these levels remain intact. As liquidity returns to high-velocity tokens, Shiba Inu (SHIB) stands among the top altcoins with a proven track record of rapid surges. This top analyst’s outlook supports the growing belief that Shiba Inu (SHIB) could deliver gains of up to 20,000% within two weeks, driven by rising on-chain activity, strong community backing, and the expanding utility of Shibarium. Momentum is building, and early buyers are preparing for what could be a dramatic short-term breakout. FloppyPepe (FPPE) Leaves The Herd Behind With Meme-o-Matic, And Explosive Presale Energy While PEPE and Shiba Inu (SHIB) ride legacy hype, FloppyPepe (FPPE) introduced something new through Meme-o-matic —its AI-powered meme generator that turns creativity into capital. Investors can now create viral memes, earn, and engage with the crypto community, merging entertainment with exponential gains. With its ongoing presale at just $0.00000035 and a mouth-watering 80% bonus through promo code FLOPPY80 , early buyers are getting in at the base level of what top analysts call the most intelligent altcoin ever built. As it goes live and whales accumulate, FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) price trajectory is expected to soar. Compared to PEPE and Shiba Inu (SHIB), FloppyPepe (FPPE) offers actual utility, smarter incentives, and explosive upside, making it the one altcoin that could mint millionaires before the rest even catch up in the next altcoin season.
